## Thrust Vector Controller Summary
* This Repository will contain code that enables my thrust vector controller to work and basic a description of my methodology of its design.
## Purchased Components
* Micro Controller- [Teensy 4.0](https://www.pjrc.com/store/teensy40.html)
  * I chose the Teensy 4.0 because its small for factor makes it easy to use and it has great computational power for it's price.
* IMU (Inertia Measurement Unit)- [Adafruit 9-DOF Absolute Orientation IMU Fusion Breakout](https://www.adafruit.com/product/2472)
  * I chose this breakout board by ada fruit because it includes Bosch's BNO055 which is an incredible sensor. 
* Servos- [SG90](http://www.ee.ic.ac.uk/pcheung/teaching/DE1_EE/stores/sg90_datasheet.pdf)
  * I chose the SG90 as my servo because of their size and price. I knew I didn't need anything too powerful for my design.
## Designed and 3D Printed components
At this point I have not printed anything so this list is subject to change.
* Motor Mount
* Gimbal
* Fuselage/Shroud
